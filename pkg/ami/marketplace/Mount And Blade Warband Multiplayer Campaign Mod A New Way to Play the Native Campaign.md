## Step 1: Install Mount And Blade Warband

## Step 2: Install Battle Time Mod
  
You can download Battle Time mod from Nexus Mods or Mod DB. The mod comes as a zip file that contains two folders: Battle Time and WSE.
  
Battle Time is the mod folder that you need to copy and paste into the Modules folder of your Mount And Blade Warband installation directory. For example, if you installed the game in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MountBlade Warband, then you need to paste the Battle Time folder into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MountBlade Warband\Modules.

This time, you will see another new option called Setup multiplayer battle. If you click this option, you will quit the game and go back to the main menu, where you can open Multiplayer and Host Game. You can then set up your server name, password, map, mode, and other settings as usual.
  
If you want to join a multiplayer battle hosted by another player, you need to open Multiplayer and Join Game. You can then find their server by name

The Panniru Thirumurai is not only a collection of hymns, but also a historical record of the Saiva tradition in Tamil Nadu. The hymns reflect the various aspects of Saiva worship, such as the temples, the rituals, the festivals, the saints, the doctrines and the experiences of the devotees. The hymns also express the personal emotions of the poets, such as love, devotion, joy, sorrow, gratitude, surrender and liberation. The hymns are composed in various forms of Tamil poetry, such as venpa, asiriya, kalive'n'pa and antati. The hymns are also set to various musical modes or pa'n'ns that enhance their beauty and appeal.
 
The Panniru Thirumurai was compiled and preserved by Nambiyandar Nambi, a scholar and a devotee of Rajaraja Chola I (985-1014 CE), one of the greatest kings of Tamil Nadu. Nambiyandar Nambi collected the hymns from various sources, such as palm-leaf manuscripts, stone inscriptions and oral traditions. He also arranged them in a logical order and added explanatory notes. He also composed an invocatory verse for each Thirumurai. Nambiyandar Nambi's work was instrumental in reviving and spreading the Saiva faith among the masses.
 
The Panniru Thirumurai is regarded as the Tamil Veda or Dravida Veda by the Saivites. It is also considered as one of the four sources of authority or pramana for Saiva Siddhanta, along with the Vedas, the Agamas and the Meykanda Shastras. The Panniru Thirumurai is revered as the voice of Lord Siva himself and as a means of attaining his grace and liberation.

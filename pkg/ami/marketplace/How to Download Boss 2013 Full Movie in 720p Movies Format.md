### Boss 2013: Movie Review
 
Boss 2013 is a typical masala entertainer that delivers what it promises: action, comedy, romance and drama. The film is a remake of the 2010 Malayalam film Pokkiri Raja, which itself was inspired by the 2006 Telugu film Vikramarkudu. The film does not have much of a plot, but relies on the charisma and screen presence of Akshay Kumar, who plays the titular role of Boss.
 
The film has some impressive action sequences, especially the ones involving Akshay Kumar and Ronit Roy, who plays the main antagonist ACP Ayushman Thakur. The film also has some hilarious moments, thanks to the comic timing of Mithun Chakraborty, Johnny Lever and Sanjay Mishra. The film also has some emotional scenes, especially between Akshay Kumar and his father and brother. The film also has some catchy songs, composed by Meet Bros Anjjan, Yo Yo Honey Singh and Chirantan Bhatt.
 
The film, however, suffers from some drawbacks, such as a weak script, poor editing, cliched dialogues and predictable twists. The film also has some unnecessary scenes, such as the item number by Sonakshi Sinha and the cameo by Prabhu Deva. The film also has some logic-defying moments, such as Akshay Kumar surviving a fall from a helicopter and Ronit Roy escaping from a bomb blast. The film also has some stereotypical characters, such as the corrupt politician (Govind Namdeo), the honest cop (Shiv Panditt) and the damsel in distress (Aditi Rao Hydari).
 
Overall, Boss 2013 is a film that caters to the masses and fans of Akshay Kumar. It is not a film that will win any awards or critical acclaim, but it is a film that will entertain you for its duration. If you are looking for a mindless fun ride with some action and comedy, you can give Boss 2013 a try.

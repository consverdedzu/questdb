## Step 1: Create a new WinForms project in Visual Studio
 
Open Visual Studio and create a new Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) project. Name it "SkinSoftDemo" and click OK. You should see a blank form in the designer.
 
## Step 2: Add some controls to the form
 
To demonstrate how SkinSoft Visual Styler works, we will add some basic controls to the form, such as buttons, labels, text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, and a progress bar. You can arrange them as you like, but here is an example layout:

## Step 3: Add a reference to SkinSoft.VisualStyler.dll
 
To use SkinSoft Visual Styler in your project, you need to add a reference to the SkinSoft.VisualStyler.dll file, which is located in the installation folder of SkinSoft Visual Styler (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\SkinSoft\VisualStyler.Net). To do this, right-click on the References node in the Solution Explorer and select Add Reference. In the Reference Manager window, browse to the SkinSoft.VisualStyler.dll file and select it. Click OK to add the reference.
 
## Step 4: Add a VisualStyler component to the form
 
The next step is to add a VisualStyler component to the form. This component is responsible for applying the skin to your application. To do this, open the Toolbox and drag and drop a VisualStyler component from the SkinSoft tab onto the form. You should see a small icon on the bottom left corner of the form.

## Step 5: Select a skin for your application
 
Now comes the fun part: choosing a skin for your application. To do this, select the VisualStyler component on the form and open its Properties window. Click on the Load button next to the StyleFile property. This will open a dialog box where you can browse through the available skins. You can also use the Filter by Category drop-down menu to narrow down your choices. For this example, we will use the "Aquanox" skin from the "Aqua" category.

Click OK to apply the skin to your application. You should see an immediate change in the appearance of your form and its controls.

## Step 6: Run your application and enjoy
 
You are done! You have successfully created a WinForms application with a custom skin using SkinSoft Visual Styler. You can run your application and see how it looks and behaves. You can also experiment with different skins and settings to find your favorite one.
